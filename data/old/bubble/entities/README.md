# Entities groups dataset
This dataset contains a combination of all entities, their ISO3 code, and each entity's group or regions classification, from multiple classifications. The data is collected from Our World in Data's [world region map definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions), World Bank's region definitions, and IMF's World Economic Outlook country lists.
The dataset is stored in the [entities.csv](https://github.com/thanhan910/Courseworks/blob/main/Swinburne/COS30045/data/bubble/entities/entities.csv) file.
